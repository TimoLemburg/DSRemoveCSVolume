DSRemoveCSVolume
================

A DeployStudio script to erase the first CoreStorage device, needed for re-installing a FileVault encrypted Mac

Be aware, that this script may cause problems when using FusionDrives, since these are also CoreStorage Volumes.
I have no access to FusionDrive Macs, so this is no issue to me and I cannot investigate this thoroughly.
